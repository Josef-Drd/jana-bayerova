    "about_p1": "My name is Jana Bayerová and I was born in the beautiful Moravian town of Boskovice in 1971. After studying at the Secondary School of Applied Arts in Brno and the Conservation-Restoration Studio at the Moravian Museum in Brno, I still live and work in Boskovice.",
    "about_p2": "My grandfather, who painted as an amateur just for himself and the family, introduced me to painting. His workshop always smelled of oil paints and turpentine, which fascinated and attracted me even as a little girl.",
    "about_p3": "I mainly paint realistic paintings with romantic themes, inspired by urban environments – especially the Jewish quarter of Boskovice, but also landscapes and places where I have spent beautiful moments. Czech painter Jakub Schikaneder became my great inspiration, whose influence can be recognized in the themes of evening street corners with melancholic mood.",
